#### Markdown Preview in Atom (IDE)
With Atom open, at that cool little top toolbar ( Sign | File | Edit | View | Selection | Find | Packages | Window | Help)

- From the toolbar; with that cute lil arrow you call a cursor.
 Go to Packages
  - Hover till that bad boy drops down all those glorious options.
    - The one you're looking for is called: **"Markdown Preview"**
- Hover on your soon to be discovered life changing experience until it shows you the option to 'Toggle Preview'
_(You will need to do this on every markdown you want to preview in pretty form)_
