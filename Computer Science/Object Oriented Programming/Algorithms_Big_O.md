Articulate what an algorithm is

### Algorithm:
- Step by step well defined computational procedure for solving a problem
  - have a goal (determination)
  - terminate at some point
  - produce output

### How to determine best suited algorithm

HOW ALGORITHMS ARE MEASURED:
##### correctness:
  - Test driven
  - Desired output

#### Memory footprint:
  - How its storing data structures

#### Speed:
  - Measured by **Big O notation**
