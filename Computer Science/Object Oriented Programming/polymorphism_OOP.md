#### Define Polymorphism:

- Presenting the same interface in different forms
  - (interface) Must have certain methods built into parent

- Same method able to be invoked / called on different types of classes/prototypes (eieio soundOFF example)

- Useful for code reuse( all of the different classes/prototypes have a consistency between classes)

- Access different property

- One thing can take different forms(give different outputs)

- Interface == table of contents types of file class

- Mixins == build up of implementations of file class(module)
