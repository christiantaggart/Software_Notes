#### Define Encapsulation [1]:

- Language construct specific to OOP Bundling data/ Hiding data.
- Used for sensitive data
- Usually done in JS through scope or IIFES
- Private & Public methods
  - Private and Public refers to how the code it's self can access methods
  - Public method is able to be invoked
  - Private method hides implementation of how the code works
- Hide objects, call method to manipulate hidden object
  - (build method for manipulation of hidden object)
- Able to hide parts of created data / Object (key: values)
- Give methods to implement but no display/ understanding of whats going on


- Encapsulation is used to refer to one of two related but distinct notions, and sometimes to the combination thereof:

  - A language mechanism for restricting direct access to some of the object's components.

  - A language construct that facilitates the bundling of data with the methods (or other functions) operating on that data.

- Programming language researchers use the first meaning alone or in combination with the second as a distinguishing feature of object-oriented programming, while some programming languages which provide lexical closures view encapsulation as a feature of the language orthogonal to object orientation.

- The second definition is motivated by the fact that in many of the OOP languages hiding of components is not automatic or can be overridden; thus, information hiding is defined as a separate notion by those who prefer the second definition.

- The features of encapsulation are supported using classes in most object-oriented programming languages, although other alternatives also exist.


- ONLY MANIPULATED BY METHODS DEFINED IN THAT CLASS
