## Dynamic linking [wiki ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_linker)
- Only happens when the program executes
- Linking is often referred to as a process that is performed when the executable is compiled.
- A dynamic linker is a special part of an operating system that loads _external shared libraries_ into a running process and then binds those shared libraries dynamically to the running process.
- This approach is also called **dynamic linking** or late linking.
