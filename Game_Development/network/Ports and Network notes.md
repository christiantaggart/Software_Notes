#### [Open Systems Interconnection model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)

"The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology.

Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard protocols.

The model partitions a communication system into abstraction layers.
The original version of the model defined seven layers.


A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that comprise the contents of that path. Two instances at the same layer are visualized as connected by a horizontal connection in that layer." - Via WIKI



#### In Gaming:
- Historically xbox / playstation /pc, online multiplayer gaming would use their own Protocol (running on some random port)
  - Designing your own protocol == messaging format (this many bites eg char pos, Other relative data)


### Ports
- The ports are: 1 - 655536
- If a certain port is used on one Protocol(UDP / TCP) it will be open on the other

#### UDP Port : Unreliable datagram protocol
- Less over head lower latency


#### [Transmission control protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol):
- TCP Port: is the default for: Websites, Most common traffic
- Guarantees delivery  due to their _Protocol_ ak


Most websites: from server to client are GZIP compress


### LATENCY == How fast the request gets sent


### BANDWIDTH == How much data can be sent


### WEBGL STILL USES CLIENTS COMPUTER (GPU) TO RENDER SCENES


### REMOTE RENDERING OR GAME STREAMING (RENDER VIA SERVER)
