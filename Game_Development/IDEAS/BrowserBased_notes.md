"Email from Sean T:
One of the biggest challenges with WebGL is that it’s CPU limited.
It has to run all the game processes on just 1 core. Other platforms can utilize all of the computer's cores (multi-threading) making games run faster.
Even after these changes, we’re still getting unacceptable frame rates on our high end development computers, which doesn’t bode well for having it run well on a wide range of hardware. At this point, adding any new features will only make performance worse.

There are few new technologies in active development (WebAssembly, Shared Array Buffers and SIMD.js) which could help since they’re supposed to enable/support multi-threading and increase javascript performance. However there’s no time frame for when these technologies will be available for public use.

I know there are some multi-player games that currently run in WebGL, however they don't usually tend to have many features. So to be like those games we'd have to strip everything out of our game, which we don’t want to do. We have a vision for what we want Time Gunners to be and we just can’t bring that vision to life with the current WebGL technology.

=========================

Here are the problems that I've experienced and seen regarding WebGL:

    The biggest issue with WebGL that I've seen is that it seems like a very immature "product."

I'm hesitant to say this, and I feel like some issues may be chalked up to my own inexperience as a developer--this was my first game, my first time using Unity, and my first time deploying via WebGL. However the problems I've encountered through WebGL seem to be persistent problems encountered by other developers who are much more experienced than myself. In particular, the biggest issue I've encountered is technological. This is frustrating as a developer, because while my code may work on my system, it might not work on another user's.
I have had many, many instances where people are unable to load the game for whatever reason such as their browser being "old" and not supporting WebGL, their browser (by default or choice) disallowing WebGL, or other issues like their computer not being able to handle WebGL's allocation.
