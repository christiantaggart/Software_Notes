  - Wolves, Cougars, Bears, Buffalo Heards, Rattle Snakes, Moose, Escaped Bovine Heards etc;

#### Game Play:
- **Player Status**:
  - Hunger & Thirst are induced by labor & body heat otherwise the value is leached by a percentage over time.
  - Injuries / Wounds / Sickness will get worse if left untreated.
   - Injuries / Wounds / Sickness are area specific E.G: broken leg will cripple client until mended reducing them to a prone crawl.
- **Combat**:
  - Slow Weapons (Fire rate) & Swords; So PvP results in calculated attacks.
   - Ammo is scarce until developed communities create mines to retrieve minerals & ore.

- **Looting**:
  - Ghost towns where Clients can loot goods from 'previous settlers' (Places in in hospitibal areas of map which caused them to perish or leave. Will need to be well prepaired before trying to make the journey to look said Ghost towns.
  - Rewards are high: sole source of modern Firearms and Modern goods (Medicinces, Garmits etc) untill Town technologically evolved enough to crafting goods at the same level of complexity.
