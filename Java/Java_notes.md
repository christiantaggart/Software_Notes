#### Compiled

- Changes human readable source code into machine-readable executable code to make execution of the software possible


#### Static vs Dynamic typing
- STATIC:
  - Every variable is given a name and a type;
  - if contents of variable are wrong type the compilation will fail;
  - Types can be int, string, float
  - Class names are types

**Advantages**:
  - Compiler can catch mistakes where you would mistype data into the wrong spots of your program
  - Forces you, the programmer, to think ahead about the one and only thing variable can contain.
  - Performance gains can be realized by treating large blocks of memory in the same way (as in Pythons NumPy)

**Dynamic Typing Advantages**:
  - Variable can contain whatever
  - Performance gain can be small or unimportant


Declare types for the variables
