#### Notes:
###### Stolen from the site;
- Automate & enhance your workflow:
  - gulp is a toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow, so you can stop messing around and build something.
- Simple Usage:
  - By preferring code over configuration, node best practices, and a minimal API surface - gulp makes things simple like never before.
- Efficient Builds:
  - Using the power of node streams, gulp gives you fast builds that don't write intermediary files to disk.
- Quality Ecosystem:
  - By enforcing strict guidelines, we ensure our plugins stay simple and work as expected.

**Install via Terminal:**
```sh
npm install gulp-cli -g
npm install gulp -D
touch gulpfile.js
gulp --help
```
